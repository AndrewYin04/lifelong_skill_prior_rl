# lifelong_skill_prior_rl

This is a rewrite of the Accelerating Reinforcement Learning with Learned Skill Priors paper's model. 

Current Progress: Rewriting & Understanding the skill priors model. Want to be trained on LIBERO dataset in an attempt to make it a lifelong rl algorithm. 

Future Plan: Implement hierarchical reinforcement learning on top of existing skill priors algorithm and compare performance.
