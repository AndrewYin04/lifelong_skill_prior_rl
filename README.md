# lifelong_skill_prior_rl

This is a rewrite of the [Accelerating Reinforcement Learning with Learned Skill Priors](https://clvrai.github.io/spirl/) paper's model. 

Current Progress: Rewriting & Understanding the skill priors model. Want to be trained on [LIBERO](https://libero-project.github.io/datasets) dataset in an attempt to make it a lifelong rl algorithm. 

Future Plan: Implement hierarchical reinforcement learning on top of existing skill priors algorithm and compare performance.

All changes currently on branch: https://github.com/AndrewYin04/lifelong_skill_prior_rl/tree/skill_embeddeding_training
